\section{Introduction to video coding}
\label{sec:introduction_to_video_coding}

\subsection{The need of video coding}
\label{sub:the_need_of_video_coding}

The purpose of video coding is to compress video files, which consist of
a sequence of images that, at some point, will be either transmitted or
stored.

For instance, a two-hour long film in \ac{HD} format ($1920 \times 1080$)
at a frame rate of 25 images per second and 8 bits to represent each one
of the \ac{RGB} channels, requires:
\[
	\frac{\unit{1920\times1080}{pix}}{\unit{1}{image}}
	\times \frac{\unit{25}{images}}{\unit{1}{s}}
	\times \unit{2}{\hour} \times \frac{\unit{3600}{s}}{\unit{1}{\hour}}
	\times \unit{3}{channels} \times \frac{\unit{8}{bits}}{\unit{1}{channel}}=
\]
\[
	= 8.957952 \times 10 ^ {12} \; \text{bits}
	= 8957.952\;\text{Gb} \approx 1043\;\text{GiB}
\]

Through this simple example, it is evident that video coding is
indispensable to store or stream video files.
Depending on the target quality, it is common to have compression rates
ranging from 100 to 1000.

For content providers, being able to reduce the size of the content they
broadcast implies increasing the number of contents they can store, as
well as the number of subscribers they can reach using the same
resources for storage and network capacity.

In 2013, two thirds of the \ac{IP} traffic was due to video
streaming, and this trend is only going to increase, reaching up to 84\%
of the \acs{IP} traffic by 2018~\cite{cisco-13-vni-forecast}.
Such statistics highlight the need of continuing the research on
new video coding techniques.

\section{The video coding system}
\label{sec:the_video_coding_system}

The video coding system describes a work flow to work with video
sequences.
It is composed of several stages, starting with the video acquisition at
the source and ending at the video display.
A good understanding of each part is crucial to be able to take the
proper decisions when delivering a video coding solution.

This section presents a scheme containing the most important concepts
used in state-of-the-art video coders.

Figure~\ref{fig:video_coding_system} describes how a complete video
coding system can be organised as a block diagram.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./figures/VideoCodingSystem.tex}
	\caption{Video coding system}
	\label{fig:video_coding_system}
\end{figure}

The composing blocks of the video system are explained more in detail in
the following subsections.

\subsection{Pre-processing}
\label{sub:pre_processing}

After the digital video has been acquired at the source, which may be of
many different sorts, such as natural scenes or synthetic
computer-generated content, it has to be processed in order to be
encoded.
Usually, the pre-processing stage can include some filtering, scaling
and colour space conversions on the raw video sequence.

\subsubsection{Colour space conversions}
\label{ssub:colour_space_conversions}
\index{HVS}
\index{YUV}
\index{gamma}
\index{luma}
\index{chroma}

Colour space conversions are used to change the colour
representation of the content to better fit the \ac{HVS}.
The raw video data is normally in \ac{RGB} format, corrected by the
transfer function of the camera ($\gamma$), hence denoted R'G'B'.

For historical reasons, in order to be backwards compatible with black
and white displays, the raw video file is converted to another colour
space that separates the light information (luma) from the colour
information (chroma), typically referred to as the YUV colour space
family~\cite{poynton-95-color-space}.
Moreover, due to the way the \ac{HVS} works, being more sensible to
light variations than to colour, this family of colour spaces supports
sub-sampling the chroma channels without any major perceptual
degradation.

\subsection{Encoding}
\label{sub:encoding}

This stage is in charge of converting the pre-processed raw video sequence
into a coded video stream to ease the storage and transmission.
A deep look at the inners of a widely used coding scheme is provided
in~\ref{sec:the_hybrid_video_coding_scheme}.

\subsection{Transmission}
\label{sub:transmission}

The transmission stage stands for the way the encoded bitstream is
transferred to the decoder.
Most typical examples are streaming and storage, which may determine
some of the encoder and decoder behaviours, like real time or memory
constraints.

\subsection{Decoding}
\label{sub:decoding}

As the stream is received by the decoder, it is buffered and used to
reconstruct the encoded data into the appropriate format, as signalled
by the encoder.
Video coding norms tend to define a standard video decoder, which
follows the implemented video coding specificication, such as \ac{AVC}
or \ac{HEVC}~\cite{itu-14-h265-hevc-rec,sullivan-12-overview-hevc}.
The encoder must comply to this specification by generating a decodable
stream.

\subsection{Post-processing}
\label{sub:post_processing}

The post-processing stage performs operations for image enhancement and
display adaptation, such as converting back to the original colour
space and to the display format.

\section{The hybrid video coding scheme}
\label{sec:the_hybrid_video_coding_scheme}

State-of-the-art video coding standards such as H.264/\acs{MPEG}-4 \acs{AVC}
and H.265/\acs{HEVC} use a hybrid video coding scheme that appeared in
H.261, in the late eighties.
Since then, all video coding standards and recommendations issued by the
\ac{ITU-T} and the \ac{MPEG} use it as their basic coding structure.

The hybrid video coding scheme is named after its use of both temporal
prediction and transform coding techniques for the prediction error.

A basic structure of the hybrid video coding scheme is presented in
figure~\ref{fig:hybrid_video_coding_scheme}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./figures/HybridVideoCodingScheme.tex}
	\caption{Hybrid video coding scheme}
	\label{fig:hybrid_video_coding_scheme}
\end{figure}

The hybrid video coding scheme provides an efficient way of compressing
a video signal into a bitstream of the smallest possible size.
The key features to achieve such a small bitstream are the signal
prediction and the transformation of the prediction error.

The encoder includes a decoder, represented inside a blue box, to be
able to perform its coding decisions based on what the decoder would do
while decoding a bitstream.

The building blocks of the hybrid video coding scheme are explained in
the following subsections.

\subsection{Partitioning}
\label{sub:partitioning}

In order to process the video frames, they are exhaustively partitioned
into non-overlapping blocks.
These blocks ease the succeeding stages of prediction and transform.
The partitioning does not have to be uniform, allowing blocks of different
sizes to be used.
The optimal choice for the block size is left to the encoder.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{./figures/partitioning-orig-all-001.png}
	\caption{Partitioning example using \acs{HEVC} at \acs{QP} 27}
	\label{fig:partitioning}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Prediction}
\label{sub:prediction}

Residual coding is video coding technique, that, instead of coding the
blocks coming from the original source image directly, computes an
estimation of the block which is then subtracted from the original
block, generating a residual block.
Those block estimations are carried out by the prediction module, using
some information from previously treated blocks.
This way, predictable information present in the original blocks will be
removed and their energy will be lowered.

Predictions must be performed the same way at both encoder and decoder
side, and this computed inside the blue box in
figure~\ref{fig:hybrid_video_coding_scheme}, referring to the decoder.
For this reason, the encoder uses reconstructed blocks (blocks that have
been already encoded and will make it to the bitstream) as the input
data to compute the predictions, as these blocks are equivalent to
those the decoder will handle.

Commonly, predictions might be of two types, depending on the origin of
the prediction source:
intra or spatial prediction for those blocks that
have been predicted using information within the same frame, and inter
or temporal prediction for those blocks predicted from other frames.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{./figures/partitioning-pred-all-001.png}
	\caption{Predicted image}
	\label{fig:predicted_image}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{./figures/partitioning-resi-all-001.png}
	\caption{Residual image (difference between original and predicted)}
	\label{fig:residual_image}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Intra prediction}
\label{ssub:intra_prediction}
\index{Intra prediction}

Intra prediction, sometimes referred to as spatial prediction, is used
to remove correlation within local regions of a picture.
The basic principle of intra prediction is that the texture of a picture
region is similar to the texture of its neighbourhood and can be
predicted from there.

The intra prediction is analysed in
Chapter~\ref{cha:the_mode_dependent_directional_transforms}, when
introducing a kind of prediction-adapted transforms.

\subsubsection{Inter prediction}
\label{ssub:inter_prediction}
\index{Inter prediction}

Inter prediction, or temporal prediction, takes advantage of the fact
that images close in time share many similarities, and that many of
their component regions will move as a whole.
Since the encoding order is not necessarily the same as the viewing
order, inter predictions can have their origins in either past or future
frames.
Regions that are covered and uncovered by other objects can be predicted
using this technique.

At the encoder side, an extra operation, called motion estimation, is
carried out.
This stage searches for the best matching area in the reference picture
for the current prediction block.

\subsection{Transform}
\label{sub:transform}

The transform stage removes remaining correlations from the residual
block, computed as the difference between the original and the predicted
blocks.
The goal of the transform is to concentrate the residual energy into as
many few coefficients as possible in the transform domain.

Considering that the subject of this thesis is centred around the
transforms for video coding, the transform stage will be explained
thoroughly in Chapter~\ref{cha:transform_coding}.

\subsection{Quantisation}
\label{sub:quantisation}
\index{QP}\index{lossy}\index{lossless}

The quantisation, applied in the transform domain, it is used to discard
any coefficient whose energy level is below a certain threshold.
High energy coefficients are also be affected by the quantisation.
In standards like \acs{HEVC}, the quantisation step is controlled by a
\ac{QP}.
It is worth noticing that it is the only non-reversible step in the whole
hybrid video coding scheme, and therefore what makes video coding lossy.
Lossless video coding can be attained by not using quantification in the
process.

% 	\caption{Example of an image at different encoding points for a

% 	\label{fig:part_orig_pred_res_image}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Entropy coding}
\label{sub:entropy_coding}
\index{CABAC}

Once the transform coefficients have been quantised, they have to be
treated to conform the bitstream.
That is, the transform coefficients are scanned to make sure they are
sorted in a way that will make the entropy coder work more efficiently.
Signalling is also conveyed into the bitstream at this point, and the
entropy coder ensures a correct binarisation while using the adequate
number of bits thanks to the \ac{CABAC}.

\section{Encoder control}
\label{sec:encoder_control}

The encoder control is used by essentially all blocks in the diagram
from figure~\ref{fig:hybrid_video_coding_scheme}.
This technique allows the encoder to take decisions related to coding
based on the application requirements.
These decisions include the block sizes and the prediction to use.

\subsection{Distortion measures}
\label{sub:distortion_measures}

\subsubsection{Mean squared error}
\label{ssub:mean_squared_error}
\index{MSE}

The \ac{MSE} is the average of the square difference between two
signals.
For two-dimensional signals, such as images, the \ac{MSE} can be computed as:

\begin{equation}
	MSE_{I,K} = \frac{1}{m\,n} \sum\limits_{i=0}^{m-1} \sum\limits_{j=0}^{n-1}
	{\left[ I(i,j) - K(i,j) \right]} ^2
	\label{eqn:mse}
\end{equation}

Where $I$ and $K$ are two images of $m \times n$ pixels.

\subsubsection{Peak signal-to-noise ratio}
\label{ssub:peak_signal_to_noise_ratio}
\index{\ac{PSNR}}

The \ac{PSNR} is an objective quality measure that computes the ratio
between the maximum possible value of a signal and the power of the
noise that affects the fidelity of its approximation.
It is usually defined in terms of the logarithmic decibel scale to cope
with the wide range that signals might have.
Defining the \ac{PSNR} in terms of the \ac{MSE} from
equation~\ref{eqn:mse}, it can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
	PSNR = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{MAX_I^2}{MSE_{I,K}}\right)
	= 20 \log_{10} (MAX_I) - 10 \log_{10} (MSE_{I,K})
	\label{eqn:psnr}
\end{equation}

For 8-bit depth images, $MAX = 2^{8} - 1 = 255$.

\subsection{Rate-distortion optimisation}
\label{sub:rate_distortion_optimisation}
\index{\ac{RDO}}

In order to carry out the most sensible decision at each time, the
encoder uses a \ac{RDO} criterion
\cite{sullivan-98-rdo-video-compression}.

Each time the encoder has to make a decision about choosing a
particular block size for the partitioning or a prediction mode, it
checks the distortion that decision might cause as well as an estimation
of the bit rate needed.
The encoder performs this computation iteratively the same block,
exploring many different coding possibilities and finally selects the
one that provides the best score in terms of rate and distortion.
This is called the \ac{RDO} loop.

As seen in the previous subsections, computing the distortion is
reasonably straightforward.
However, estimating the bit rate is a bit more delicate, since the whole
entropy coder cannot be run each time the encoder explores the different
possibilities for a block.
As a consequence, an approximation of the bit rate is used in the
\ac{RDO} loop.

\subsection{Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta measurements}
\label{sub:bjontegaard_delta_measurements}
\index{\ac{BD}-rate}
\index{\ac{BD}-\ac{PSNR}}

Metrics introduced by Gisle Bj{\o}ntegaard, know as \ac{BD} measurements
have become the current \emph{de facto} standard to objectively compare
the result of two encodings~\cite{VCEG-M33,VCEG-AI11}.  Two different
metrics are defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \ac{BD}-rate: computes the relative savings in bit rate for an
		equivalent distortion in percent.
	\item \ac{BD}-\ac{PSNR}: computes the relative quality improvement
		in \deci\bel.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions_video_coding}

This chapter has presented the motivation for video coding as well as an
overview of the video coding system.

Current video coders exploit both redundancies existing within images of
the video sequence via predictions.
These predictions can be either spatial or temporal, depending on
whether the prediction source is the same image or another image,
respectively.
Unpredictable parts of the image, called residuals, are then transformed
in order to concentrate their energy in as few coefficients as possible.

Next chapter will explore the details of the transforms used in video
coding, namely their design principles and a comparison between two
design approaches.

\chapter{Transform coding}
\label{cha:transform_coding}
\chaptertoc

\section{Introduction to transforms}
\label{sec:introduction_to_transforms}

In the previous chapter, transforms were mentioned as an important part
in current video coders.
This chapter will study their design and properties that lead transforms
to be useful in video coding.

A transform is a mathematical operation that takes an input signal and
represents the same input signal in a different domain.

High energy compaction provided by transform coding has led this
technique to be present in the international video coding standards.

Transform coding allows removing existing signal correlations in the
spatial domain, leading to a decorrelated signal in the transform
domain.
This is of great importance for the upcoming stages of scanning and
entropy coding.

Transforms can be very abstract since they tend to work in N-dimensional
spaces.
However, restraining ourselves to two dimensions, one of the most visual
and representative example of transforms are rotations.
The example in figure~\ref{fig:transform_rotation} helps visualising the
transform role in signal compression.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{figures/TransformRotation.tex}
	\caption{Simple transform performing a rotation}
	\label{fig:transform_rotation}
\end{figure}

Whereas on the left signal (in blue), both the horizontal and vertical
dimensions are needed to describe the signal completely, on the right
signal (in red), the vertical dimension is enough to provide an equally
accurate signal representation, since the horizontal dimension remains
constant.

\section{Block-based transforms}
\label{sec:block_based_transforms}

Amongst all the different kinds of transforms available, the ones used
in image and video coding applications are the block-based transforms
due to the good trade-off they provide in terms of complexity and
performance.

\section{Separability}
\label{sec:separability}

Image and video coding deal with image blocks, which are two-dimensional
signals and, consequently, use transforms able two deal with those
signals.

The naive approach to work with those signals is to use non-separable
transforms.
These transforms take the signal as a whole and reshape it to a
single-dimensional signal.
Afterwards the transform is applied normally.
The main disadvantage of this approach is the number of calculations
required to obtain the transformed signal.

\section{Transform design}
\label{sec:transform_design}
\def\x{\mathbf{x}}
\def\c{\mathbf{c}}
\def\A{\mathbf{A}}

\begin{equation}
	J(\lambda) = \text{Distortion} + \lambda \text{Rate}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	J(\lambda) = \sum\limits_{\forall i}{\Vert \x_i - \A^T \c_i \Vert}_2^2
	+ \lambda r_i
\end{equation}

The \ac{KLT}

\subsection{The rate-distortion optimised transforms}
\label{sub:the_rate_distortion_optimised_transforms}
\index{RDOT}

In order to better fit the video coding demands, Sezer proposes a kind
of transforms that take into account the sparsity of the output in their
design~\cite{sezer-11-phd}

\begin{equation}
	\A_{opt} = \text{arg}\min\limits_{\A}
	\sum_{\forall i} \min\limits_{\c_i}
	\left(
	{\Vert \x_i - \A^T\c_i \Vert}_2^2 + \lambda{\Vert \c_i \Vert}_0
	\right)
	\label{eqn:rdot-nsep}
\end{equation}

Where $\x_i$ is a block of the training set, $\c_i$ are its quantised
transformed coefficients using the transform $\A$.
$\A^T$ is its transposed matrix, as $\A$ is chosen orthonormal.
The constraint in the cost function is the $\ell_0$ norm of the coefficients,
i.e.\ the number of non-zero coefficients.
The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ of the constraint only depends on the
quantisation accuracy applied to the coefficients, as demonstrated
in~\cite{sezer-11-phd}.
